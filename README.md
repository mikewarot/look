Long ago, and far away, there was an MS-DOS program called LIST.COM, that I used for viewing things. I wrote my own clone back then, of course, for viewing files, doing hex dumps, etc.

This is a GUI based replacement for it, for various other projects. It's written in Lazarus/Free Pascal, with the inital target being Windows 10.
